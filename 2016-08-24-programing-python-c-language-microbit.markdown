There are many programming languages available on the microbit: Python, Touch Develop, Javascript and C++. **Here's how to use the languages:**

## Main Language Options

### Touch Develop

![touch develop editor](/blog/images/2016-08-24-touch-develop.png "Microbit Touch Develop Editor"){:.ui .medium .centered .image}

[Touch Develop](https://www.touchdevelop.com/app/) is a Microsoft block-based coding system. It's quite advanced, and quite different to everything else available.

### PXT.io
![PXT Editor](/blog/images/2016-08-24-pxt.png "PXT.io editor from microsoft"){:.ui .medium .centered .image}

[PXT.io](https://www.pxt.io/) from Microsoft is a block- and text-based javascript editor. The user can use drag-and-drop blocks to write code and switch their blocks into javascript to edit it as text.

### mu Python Editor

The [mu python editor](http://codewith.mu/) is an offline editor for writing Python code. It will check code for errors and will flash the microbit's hex file itself. It is updated frequently so be sure to use a recent version.

## Other Editors

### Code Kingdoms

[The Code Kingdom](https://www.microbit.co.uk/app/#create:tomwku) javascript editor is more of a blocks-based editor. The blocks are formatted in Javascript although you cannot edit the underlying code. 


### Python (online)

You can write and compile hex files on the [online Python editor](https://www.microbit.co.uk/app/#list:installed-scripts:create:xyelfe). It's visually similar to the mu python text editor. It does not support many of the more advanced functions now available in Python for the microbit. The mu editor is a much better choice for coding

### C++ 

The microbit will run code written in C++.

It can be difficult setting it up and documentation is lacking at the moment. The best resources are at [ARM](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Microbit/) and [I Programmer](http://www.i-programmer.info/about-us.html).
