Christmas Holidays and I've had time to put the updated websit online. I've tried to add how to do most of the things I've been asked. 

A few other things I'm keen to add or update:

* Info on evothings.
* Apache Cordova & Ionic kitchen sink app showing the basics.
* More I2C devices.
* Markdown files to components, tools, etc, on github/gitlab.
* Sort the 'Python Code' section.
* How to communicate with the microbit over Bluetooth from computer.


The website started off as a collection of python programs collected from github. I've added how to use components and how to do _stuff_ like datalogging or using visual basic. Hopefully it's more useful.

I'll also start sending out the mailing list. The [sign up form is here.](http://eepurl.com/cwE5sX)
